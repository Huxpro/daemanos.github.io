# Projects

## Personal

### Jet database engine

The Jet database engine grew out of a class project in which I collaborated
with three other team members to create a database for a fictional game with
Java and the H2 database engine.

Over the course of the project, there was so much duplicated code in the
creation of tables that I created a small utility class to abstract out some
of the details. Jet is the distillation and generalization of that and other
database utilities, enabling the rapid creation of sophisticated databases in
pure Java.

It is available [on Github](https://github.com/daemanos/jet) under an MIT
license.

### Lexis

Lexis is a utility for generating dictionaries from Markdown source files. I
have developed it on-and-off over the course of several years for my own
personal use in conlanging, and recently decided to clean it up and release it
[on Github](https://github.com/daemanos/lexis).

### Flags

I am a hobbyist vexillologist and occasionally make flags; you can see some of
them [here](/proj/flags). I also have a personal flag which I explain in
detail on [its own page](/about/personalflag).
