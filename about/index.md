# About Me

I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology currently pursing a
bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My academic interests include artificial
intelligence and the control problem, computational linguistics, consciousness,
and theoretical mathematics, among others. I've also recently become more
interested in computing security, especially as it relates to the problems of
AI and algorithmic security.

I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with my mom, sister, [two
cats](/images/cats.jpg)[^cats], and [Felix](/images/felix.jpg), and I currently
live in Rochester, New York.

I am fueled by a combination of black coffee and herbal tea.

[^cats]: Their names are Max (left) and Kiki (right).
