# About Me

I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology currently pursing a
bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My academic
interests include artificial intelligence and the control problem,
computational linguistics, consciousness, and theoretical mathematics, among
others. I've also recently become more interested in computing security,
especially as it relates to the problems of AI and algorithmic security.

I love to read, solve puzzles, and [invent languages][conlang]. I've played the
piano since middle school, have recently started learning how to cook, and I
also like [flags][vexillology] (you can see some of the flags I've designed at
the [flag gallery](/proj/flags), and my personal flag
[here](/about/personalflag)).

I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with my mom, sister, [Max, Kiki][cats],
and [Felix][felix], and currently live in Rochester, New York.

I am fueled by a combination of black coffee and herbal tea.
