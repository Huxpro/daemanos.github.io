# My Personal Flag

<img style="float: left; margin: 2em;" src="/assets/images/flags/personal.png" alt="Missing" width="300" />

I am a hobbyist vexillologist, and so in 2017 I created a flag to represent me,
shown at left. Its elements and color palette symbolize elements of my
personality and concepts which are important to me. In particular, purple
represents knowledge, blue represents peace, tranquility, and level-headedness,
and yellow represents parsimony. The six semi-circles were not originally
intended to represent anything in and of themselves, but six is a relatively
interesting number in number theory (it is the smallest [perfect
number][perfect], for instance), and so could be taken to represent my
interest in theoretical mathematics.

The implied hexagon formed by the semi-circles represents an emergent object
which is greater than the sum of its parts, in this case the mind. Finally, the
three white stripes represent the [three marks of existence][marks], concepts
from Buddhist philosophy of central importance to the practice of [Vipassanā
meditation][meditation], of which I am a practitioner.
